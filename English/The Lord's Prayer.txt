Our code in the file,
You are hallowed for debugging,
Coming to compile,
The algorithm is done on x64 as it did on x86.
Give us the resources we need today,
As we have corrected the bug that we have sinned against us
Forgive us our a typing errors,
Do not make us compile errors,
Just get it from the legacy.
One of the time complexity and spatial complexity values is forever in the code.
